#CORDIC#
This is a working implementation of a non working algorithm

##Introduction##
The goal of this project is to design an integrated digital circuit which implements a converter from cartesian coordinates to polar ones, using the CORDIC algorithm.
CORDIC is an acronym for COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer and it was first described by Jack E. Volder in 1959. CORDIC has two mode of operation: rotation and vector. The former mode takes the coordinates of an input vector plus an angle of rotation and returns the new coordinates after the rotation has been applied. 
The vector mode can convert an input vector from cartesian to polar coordinates and its result depends on multiple iterations of the CORDIC rotation mode.
This project aims to implement CORDIC in vector mode.
